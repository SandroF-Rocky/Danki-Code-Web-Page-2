# Danki Code Web Page 2
 


This is an improved version of the first Danki Landing Page. In this code, I learned how to embed google maps to my *HTML*. We have a responsive menu on the header of the page where there is a background-image instead of a div with a <img> within.

The color pallete makes this design unique and stoning

There are 6 diferent sections inside our code, each one for a given purpose

Way down we have our form where you can shoot emails in a simple way and our embed map

It's simple, it's responsive, it's attractive!

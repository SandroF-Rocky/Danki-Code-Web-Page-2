# Danki Code Web Page 2
 


 This is an improved version of the first Danki Landing Page. In this code, I learned how to embed google maps to my *HTML*. We have a responsive menu on the header of the page where there is a background-image instead of a div with a <img> within.
 
 Way down we have our form where you can shoot emails and our embed map
 
 .It's simple, responsive and attractive!
